# Chinese Checkers

A chinese checkers game in pygame. Almost all the code was written in 2â€“3 days so it isn't the cleanest. Click on the pieces to move them, press the space bar to let the AI choose a move, press "r" to reset the board, and use control Z to undo a move. The blue line indicates what the AI suggests as the best move. The board is modeled of this real one I own,
